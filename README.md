open a terminal at the root of the project and run `cd backend/UCN-Semester-3-project && dotnet run --project RecipeRestService`

### frontend
open a terminal at the root of the project and run `cd frontend` then `npm i` and after that `npm start`

### Go to application
when the services are running go to http://localhost:3000/app to see the frontend and https://localhost:7088/swagger for the backend
